# quaderno-ruby

Quaderno-ruby is a ruby wrapper for [Quaderno API] (https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-api).
As the API, it's mostly CRUD.

Current version is 1.7.2 See the changelog [here](https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-ruby/blob/master/changelog.md)

## Installation & Configuration

To install add the following to your Gemfile:
a
```ruby
  gem 'quaderno', require: 'quaderno-ruby'
```

To configure just add this to your initializers

```ruby
  Quaderno::Base.configure do |config|
    config.auth_token = 'my_authenticate_token'
    config.url = 'https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/v1/'
  end
```

**1.7.1 Breaking changes:** If you are using a configuration based on versions `< '1.7.1'`, you will notice that the old configuration no longer works, so please update your configuration or specify the `1.7.0` version.

## Get authorization data

You can get your account subdomain by grabbing it from your account url or by calling the authorization method with your personal api token.

```ruby
  Quaderno::Base.authorization 'my_authenticate_token', environment
  # => {"identity"=>{"id"=>737000, "name"=>"Walter White", "email"=>"cooking@br.bd", "href"=>"https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/v1/"}}
```

`environment` is an optional argument. By passing `:sandbox`, you will retrieve your credentials for the sandbox environment and not for production.

This will return a hash with the information about your api url, which includes the account subdomain.

## Ping the service
 You can ping the service in order to check if it is up with:

```ruby
  Quaderno::Base.ping #=> Boolean
```

This will return true if the service is up or false if it is not.

## Check the rate limit

```ruby
  Quaderno::Base.rate_limit_info #=>  {:reset=>4, :remaining=>0}
```

This will return a hash with information about the seconds until the rate limit reset and your remaining requests per minute ([check the API documentation for more information](https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-api#rate-limiting)).
